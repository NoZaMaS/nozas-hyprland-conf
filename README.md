# hyprland-conf

# --- INTRO

  Just a nice way for myself to organize and stock all of my linux/hypr thingies (.conf files, wallpapers, etc...)

  I could also make use of it to share some of my (terrible) code with someone who'd (somehow) need it.

# --- CONTACT INFOS

  If I ever set this or any of my repos public, you can always contact via discord. Sent me an invite to "nozamas", I'll 
add and try to help you (be wary of timezones (sorry for being European)).
