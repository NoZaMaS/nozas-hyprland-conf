# hyprland-conf

## --- INTRO ---

  Just a nice way for myself to organize and stock all of my linux/hypr thingies (.conf files, wallpapers, etc...)

  It's pretty bare-bones for now, but I'm looking forward to implement [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww?tab=readme-ov-file) soon enough.

## --- PRE-REQUISITES ---

  [How to install hyprland](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/)
  You should also use zsh (using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install) for convenience sake)
  Using [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) would be for the best.

  `yay -S pywal swww`

## --- CONTACT INFO ---

  If I ever set this or any of my repos public, you can always contact via discord. Sent me an invite to "nozamas", I'll 
add and try to help you (be wary of timezones (sorry for being European)).
